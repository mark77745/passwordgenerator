Password Generator website (backup of password-gen.com)

This is a very simple, straight backup of passwordgenerator.net (and now password-gen.com). 
It generates complex passwords at varying lengths and allows customisations to be made i.e. don't start with a letter, 
don't use characters like i, l, 1, L, o, 0, O, etc

I do not own this source code.
